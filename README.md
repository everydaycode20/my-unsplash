![gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsr3ncf1/image/upload/v1622857634/gif_unsplash_nyyzsa.gif)

This is [the second challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP) of the [Full-stack](https://devchallenges.io/paths/full-stack-developer) path from devChallenges. Although the aim of this challenge was to make an app to save photos, I wanted to take a step further by adding authentication. I've used Passportjs with Local Strategy.

## How to use

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/everydaycode20/my-unsplash

## You should have mongodb installed on your computer or a Mongodb Atlas account

# Install dependencies for both folders
$ npm install

# For client folder make a build
$ npm run build

# Copy and paste build folder from client to server folder

# Run the app from the server folder
$ npm start
```
